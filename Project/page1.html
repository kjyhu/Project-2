        <h1>Background of Gun Violence</h1>
        <p>People in the United States have the right to own firearms due to the second amendment of the Constitution. As data shown, the United States is in the lead
            with a ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents way ahead of the other civilian-gun owning countries. These data also implicitly shows the issue with that
            high of firearm owning rate and has recently caught the attention of many people as there are increasing incidents of gun shooting in the United States.

        <p>
            From 2011 to 2020 the amount of deaths due to gun has rised 33% which means that there were 12,871 more
            gun deaths in 2011, including suicide and homicide. This statistic definitely brought attention to many people
            including the public as the amount of deaths related to firearms increases dramatically. Many people begin taking
            actions and asking for gun controls as massive public shootings occur frequently.
