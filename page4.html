            <p>As the number of gun violence and school shootings continues to increase, there should be
                a solution in how to stop the numbers from rising. I personally think that there should be more
                laws enforcing background check and reducing easy access to weapons so that it is less likely for
                bad people to get their hands on weapon. We can also help by protesting against gun violence and
                gathering
                public support for laws to enforce stricter gun control laws.

<!--This page is the hardest of all because of the photo gallery and creating the form.
I didn't really style the form that much because I forgot to use the sites when I had that
lesson therefore it isn't that beautiful. The other thing that bothers me was retrieving it
which also brought some problems.-->
